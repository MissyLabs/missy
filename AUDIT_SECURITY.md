# Security Audit Report

## Date: 2026-03-18

## Threat Model

### 1. Prompt Injection
- **Defense**: `InputSanitizer` with 250+ patterns, Unicode normalization, base64 decode
- **Detection**: Multi-language support, nested encoding detection
- **Response**: Logged to audit trail, user warned, input sanitized

### 2. Plugin Abuse
- **Defense**: Plugin allowlist in config, disabled by default
- **Detection**: Permission declarations required
- **Response**: Blocked at policy engine

### 3. Data Exfiltration
- **Defense**: Default-deny network policy, CIDR/domain/host allowlists
- **Detection**: All outbound HTTP goes through PolicyHTTPClient
- **Response**: Blocked and audit logged

### 4. SSRF
- **Defense**: PolicyHTTPClient validates all URLs against network policy

## Persona Security Boundaries

The persona system enforces:
- Never execute destructive operations without confirmation
- Never expose secrets or credentials
- Always respect policy engine decisions
- Flag security concerns proactively

These boundaries are injected into every LLM system prompt.

## File Permission Hardening (Session 3)

All directory creation under `~/.missy/` now uses `mode=0o700` to prevent
other users on shared systems from reading sensitive configuration, audit logs,
memory databases, or identity keys.

Sensitive files (persona, hatching state, vault) are created with `mode=0o600`
using `os.open()` with restrictive flags (`O_CREAT | O_TRUNC` or `O_CREAT | O_APPEND`).

### Files hardened

## Session 10 Security Audit

### Vulnerabilities Found and Fixed

| # | Finding | Severity | Fix |
|---|---------|----------|-----|
| 1 | Missing `Referrer-Policy` header in screencast server | **Medium** | Added `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` to `_SECURITY_HEADERS` |
| 2 | `int()` ValueError crash on non-numeric frame fields | **Medium** | Added try/except ValueError/TypeError with error response |
| 3 | Dimension validation bypass (width=0 or height=0) | **Low** | Changed guard from `width and height` to `width or height` |

### Details

**Referrer-Policy (server.py):** The screencast share URL embeds the plaintext auth token as a query parameter. Without `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`, this token could leak via the HTTP `Referer` header when the capture page loads external resources. Fixed by adding the header to the security headers dict.

**int() ValueError (server.py):** Client-supplied `width`, `height`, and `seq` fields were cast with `int()` without catching `ValueError`/`TypeError`. A malicious client sending `"width": "abc"` would crash the connection handler. Fixed by wrapping in try/except and sending a protocol error.

**Dimension bypass (server.py):** The validation `if width and height and not (...)` was short-circuit when either was 0, allowing `width=0, height=1080` to bypass dimension bounds checking. Fixed by changing to `if (width or height) and not (...)`.

### Additional Audit Findings (No Fix Required)

- CSP uses `script-src 'unsafe-inline'` — required for the capture page's inline JS; no user-controlled data is reflected into the page
- Token in URL query params — by design for browser-based sharing; mitigated by Referrer-Policy and no-store Cache-Control
- No auth brute-force rate limiting — mitigated by 256-bit token entropy (secrets.token_urlsafe(32))
- SessionManager has no explicit thread safety — safe under asyncio single-threaded model (GIL provides incidental protection)
- Self-signed TLS cert has 10-year validity — acceptable for local-only dev tool

## Session 9 Security Audit

### Vulnerabilities Found and Fixed

| # | Finding | Severity | Fix |
|---|---------|----------|-----|
| 1 | `self_create_tool.py` delete path traversal | **Medium** | Added `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$` regex validation + `resolve()` parent check |
| 2 | `gateway/client.py` REST policy fail-open | **Medium** | Changed `_check_rest_policy` catch-all to fail-closed (deny on error) |

### Details

**Path Traversal (self_create_tool.py):** The `delete` action did not validate `tool_name` with the same regex used by `create`. A tool_name like `../../.missy/config` could resolve to paths outside the custom tools directory, allowing arbitrary file deletion. Fixed by: (1) applying the same alphanumeric regex, (2) verifying resolved paths stay under tools_dir.

**Fail-Open REST Policy (gateway/client.py):** The `_check_rest_policy` method had a broad `except Exception` that silently allowed requests when the REST policy engine threw unexpected errors. If the REST policy had a bug, requests would bypass L7 controls. Changed to fail-closed: unexpected errors now raise `PolicyViolationError`.

### Additional Audit Findings (No Fix Required)

- Input sanitizer is advisory (detection-only, callers decide policy) — by design
- `self_create_tool` blocklist is bypassable via string concatenation — mitigated by Docker sandbox
- Base64 detection has 20-char minimum — acceptable for practical payloads

## Session 6 Security Audit

### Vulnerabilities Found and Fixed

| # | Finding | Severity | Fix |
|---|---------|----------|-----|
| 1 | Discord attachment filename path traversal | **Medium** | `os.path.basename()` + null-byte strip + `realpath` guard |
| 2 | `code_evolution` shell injection via `test_command` | **Medium** | Replaced `shell=True` with `shlex.split()` + `shell=False` |
| 3 | `file_write` symlink TOCTOU (missing O_NOFOLLOW) | **Low** | Added `O_NOFOLLOW` to `os.open()` flags |
| 4 | `AgentIdentity.save()` permission leak on overwrite | **Low** | Added `os.chmod()` after write (O_TRUNC preserves old mode) |

### Audit Methodology

- Automated search for unsafe patterns: `yaml.load`, `shell=True`, `pickle`, `eval`, `exec`
- Path traversal review: all user-input-to-path constructions
- SQL injection review: all raw SQL in SQLite stores
- Secret logging review: all `logger.info/debug` calls near credential variables
- File permission review: all `os.open` / `Path.open` calls
